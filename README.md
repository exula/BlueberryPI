BlueberryPI
==============

A bluetooth prxoximity detection script along with a TV kiosk display of who is in and out!

Testing
==============
I've included a vagrant file and a bootstrap script which will get a development enviroment up and running for you.
In the future I will make the development enviroment fake Bluetooth better so you can 'scan' and 'ping' devices.

    vagrant up

 will start your development enviroment and you can get to it at the frontend at http://localhost:8080/ and the admin at http://localhost:8080/
